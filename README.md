# Horiseon


## Description
We were asked to work with existing code in order to better handle client-side site experience. CSS/HTML code redundancies were cleaned, broken links were reorganized, and semantic HTML elements were replaced. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges

* Having little experience in HTML/CSS
*  Having little previous exposure to semantic elements
* Having little GitHub experience, leading to a wipe and reset of the repository
* Having said wipe lead to 0 commit history because of reupload.

## Future Implementations
* Active CSS elements for better user interfacing
* More robust hyperlink systems
* Better SEO criteria

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image was a mockup from the client of the intended page viewing:
