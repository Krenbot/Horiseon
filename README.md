# Horiseon

## Deployed Link
https://krenbot.github.io/Horiseon/

## Description
We were asked to work with existing code in order to better handle client-side site experience. CSS/HTML code redundancies were cleaned, broken links were reorganized, and semantic HTML elements were replaced. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges

* Having little experience in HTML/CSS
*  Having little previous exposure to semantic elements
* Having little GitHub experience, leading to a wipe and reset of the repository
* Having said wipe lead to 0 commit history because of reupload.

## Future Implementations
* Active CSS elements for better user interfacing
* More robust hyperlink systems
* Better SEO criteria

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
